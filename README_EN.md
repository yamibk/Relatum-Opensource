## What is Relatum?

Relatum is an open-source, local-first freeform knowledge canvas and study workspace. Create and connect ideas on an infinite canvas, organize course notes and research material, or turn an existing structure into a polished mind map with one click.

No account is required. Canvases, preferences, and optional AI credentials stay on your computer by default. Relatum is designed for Windows users looking for a visual note-taking app, a personal knowledge management (PKM) workspace, or an Obsidian Canvas-compatible workflow with extensive customization.

## Highlights

### A truly customizable freeform canvas

- Create, move, and connect nodes anywhere on an infinite canvas.
- Customize colors, size, shape, corner radius, opacity, font weight, text scale, and alignment.
- Style connections with different colors, paths, and line types; add handwriting, text boxes, color blocks, and decorative shapes.
- Basic compatibility with the Obsidian Canvas `nodes + edges` structure.

### One-click mind map layout

- Turn selected nodes or an entire connected structure into a mind map.
- Choose from multiple node, color, and connection presets.
- Adjust branch colors, hierarchy sizes, spacing, layout direction, and line styles.
- Keep editing after layout: move nodes, restyle them, and reorganize branches freely.

### Notes, documents, and visual research

- Markdown, math, Mermaid diagrams, code, images, PDF files, and Markdown attachments.
- Long-form reading, PDF/Markdown annotations, canvas search, minimap, and relationship graph.
- Import Markdown folders and export canvas content or PNG images.

### A study workspace beyond note-taking

- Pomodoro and stopwatch focus modes linked to study or daily tasks.
- Daily tasks, study boards, calendar and diary, countdowns, quick notes, and spaced review.
- Activity statistics, yearly progress, and task archives.

### Personalization, templates, and optional AI

- Soft gradients, immersive presets, and custom image backgrounds.
- Reusable custom templates and preset decorative shapes.
- Optional AI assistant for conversation, organizing content, and generating confirmed results onto the canvas.
- AI endpoint, model, and API key are configured by the user; the key is stored locally.

## Quick start

### Download the Windows app

1. [Download the latest `Relatum-release.zip`](https://github.com/yamibk/Relatum-Opensource/releases/latest/download/Relatum-release.zip).
2. Fully extract the ZIP into a writable folder.
3. Run `Relatum.exe`.

Relatum supports Windows 10/11 and requires Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime, which is normally included with modern Windows installations.

> Do not overwrite an old installation in place. Keep the old `data/` and `canvases/` folders until you have confirmed that the new version works, then migrate your personal data.

### Run from source

Source mode requires Windows 10/11 and Python 3.9 or later. The runtime path uses only the Python standard library:

```powershell
python app.py
```

You can also double-click `打开画布.bat`, or run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\start.ps1
```

On first launch, Relatum creates:

- `canvases/` for `.canvas` files and their attachments.
- `data/` for recent items, study records, calendar data, window state, and AI configuration.

Both directories are excluded by `.gitignore` and are not part of the source repository. See the [privacy documentation](docs/PRIVACY.md) for the complete data boundary.

## Build the Windows desktop app

Desktop builds support Python 3.9–3.12. The build script creates a temporary environment and installs pinned versions of PyWebView, PyInstaller, and Pillow:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\build-desktop.ps1
```

The output is placed in the sibling `Relatum-release/` directory. User `data/` and `canvases/` are never bundled into the release.

## Project structure

```text
Relatum/
├─ app.py                    Local HTTP service and data API
├─ desktop.py                Windows desktop shell
├─ assets/                   HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and runtime assets
├─ packaging/                Icon, font, and desktop build helpers
├─ build-desktop.ps1         Windows release build entry point
├─ start.ps1                 Source-mode launcher
├─ AI笔记创作指南.md          Prompt guide for AI canvas generation
└─ AGENTS.md                 Architecture and maintenance constraints
```

## Development and checks

Relatum has no npm build step. Before submitting a change, run at least:

```powershell
python -m py_compile app.py desktop.py packaging\make_icon.py packaging\make_font_subset.py

Get-ChildItem assets -Recurse -Filter *.js |
  Where-Object { $_.FullName -notmatch '\\vendor\\' } |
  ForEach-Object { node --check $_.FullName }

powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check-public.ps1
```

Before creating a public ZIP or formal release, also run:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\check-public.ps1 -Physical
```
